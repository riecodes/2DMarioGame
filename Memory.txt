# Comprehensive Analysis Plan for 2DMARIOGAME (JavaFX, Maven, FXML, NetBeans 25)

## 1. Project Overview & Goals
- **Objective:**  
  Develop a 2D Mario-style platformer game using JavaFX (FXML for UI), following OOP and EDP principles, with persistent data storage, robust error handling, and a user-friendly, interactive GUI.
- **Target Platform:**  
  Desktop (Windows, cross-platform via Java)
- **Development Environment:**  
  Apache NetBeans 25, Maven project structure

---

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1. High-Level Structure
- **MVC Pattern:**  
  - **Model:** Game logic, player stats, level data, file handling
  - **View:** FXML-based UI, JavaFX scenes, sprites, animations
  - **Controller:** Event handling, user input, game state transitions

### 2.2. Class Design (OOP)
- **Core Classes:**  
  - `GameEngine` (main loop, state management)
  - `Player` (inherits from `Entity`, encapsulates movement, stats)
  - `Enemy` (inherits from `Entity`, polymorphic behavior)
  - `Entity` (base class for all game objects)
  - `Level` (loads and manages level data)
  - `FileManager` (handles save/load, serialization)
  - `GameController` (JavaFX controller, event listeners)
  - `UIManager` (manages menus, HUD, settings)
- **OOP Principles:**  
  - **Encapsulation:** Private fields, public getters/setters
  - **Inheritance:** `Player`/`Enemy`/`Item` inherit from `Entity`
  - **Polymorphism:** Overridable methods for movement, collision, etc.
  - **Abstraction:** Abstract base classes/interfaces for extensibility

## 3. Graphical User Interface (GUI) Design

### 3.1. FXML Structure
- **FXML Files:**  
  - `MainMenu.fxml` (start, load, settings)
  - `GameScreen.fxml` (gameplay, HUD)
  - `Settings.fxml` (audio, controls)
  - `GameOver.fxml` (score, retry/exit)
- **JavaFX Components:**  
  - `Pane`, `Canvas` for rendering game
  - `Button`, `Label`, `TextField` for UI
  - `ImageView` for sprites

### 3.2. User Experience
- **Navigation:**  
  - Main menu with clear options (Start, Load, Settings, Exit)
  - In-game pause menu
  - Game over and victory screens
- **Accessibility:**  
  - Keyboard navigation, tooltips, clear instructions
- **Visual Feedback:**  
  - Animations for actions, transitions, and feedback (e.g., coin collection, damage)

## UI/UX Update
- The Settings screen will be a simple menu (not omitted, but minimal functionality).
- The Game Over screen will appear only when the player touches an enemy.
- Reaching the flag will show a 'You Win' screen instead of Game Over.

## 4. Event-Driven Programming (EDP)

### 4.1. Event Handling
- **User Input:**  
  - Keyboard events for movement/jump (KeyListener/JavaFX equivalents)
  - Mouse events for menu navigation
- **Game Events:**  
  - Collision detection (player-enemy, player-item)
  - Level completion, player death, score updates
- **UI Events:**  
  - Button clicks (start, pause, settings)
  - Form submissions (settings, high scores)

### 4.2. Event Listeners
- Use JavaFX event handlers (`setOnAction`, `setOnKeyPressed`, etc.)
- Decouple event logic from UI for testability

---

## 5. File Handling & Data Persistence

### 5.1. Data to Persist
- Player progress (levels completed, scores)
- Settings (audio, controls)
- High scores

### 5.2. Implementation
- **File Types:**  
  - Use text files (CSV/JSON) or Java serialization for save data
- **Classes:**  
  - `FileManager` for reading/writing data
  - Use `FileReader`, `FileWriter`, `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`
- **Serialization:**  
  - For complex objects (player stats, levels), use Java's `Serializable` interface
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Try-catch blocks for all file operations
  - User feedback on load/save errors

---

## 6. Data Validation & Error Handling

### 6.1. Validation
- Validate user input (e.g., player name, settings)
- Validate file data (check for corruption, missing fields)

### 6.2. Exception Handling
- Use try-catch for all risky operations (file I/O, parsing)
- Log errors for debugging
- Show user-friendly error messages

---

## 7. Game Logic & Mechanics

### 7.1. Core Mechanics
- Player movement (left/right/jump)
- Gravity and collision detection
- Enemies with simple AI (patrol, chase)
- Collectibles (coins, power-ups)
- Level progression

### 7.2. Game Loop
- Use JavaFX `AnimationTimer` for the main game loop
- Update game state, render, and process input each frame

---

## 8. Testing & Quality Assurance

### 8.1. Unit Testing
- Test core logic (movement, collision, file handling)
- Use JUnit for model and utility classes

### 8.2. Integration Testing
- Test full game flow (start, play, save, load, game over)

### 8.3. User Testing
- Gather feedback on usability, difficulty, and bugs

---

## 9. Documentation & Submission

### 9.1. Documentation
- **Project Overview:** Purpose, features, architecture
- **Class Diagrams:** UML for OOP structure
- **Screenshots:** Key screens (menu, gameplay, settings)
- **How to Run:** Build and run instructions (Maven, NetBeans)
- **OOP/EDP Concepts:** Where and how they are applied
- **File Handling:** Explanation and code snippets

### 9.2. Demo Video
- Short video showing gameplay, menus, save/load, and settings

### 9.3. Presentation
- 5-10 minute presentation covering design, features, and demo

## 11. Implementation Timeline (Suggested)

1. **Week 1:** Requirements analysis, class design, FXML wireframes
2. **Week 2:** Implement core classes, basic game loop, and player movement
3. **Week 3:** Add enemies, collectibles, and level logic
4. **Week 4:** Implement file handling, save/load, and settings
5. **Week 5:** Polish UI, add animations, error handling, and validation
6. **Week 6:** Testing, documentation, demo video, and presentation prep

## Asset Plan Update
- The game will use a solid color background (no background image required by default).
- Only a single level will be implemented initially; multi-level support can be added later if needed.
- All game assets (Mario, block, coin, enemy, flag) will use JavaFX shapes as placeholders until the actual images are provided.
- Asset directory: src/main/resources/assets/ (for future image assets).

This plan ensures your 2DMARIOGAME project will be robust, maintainable, and fully aligned with your rubric and course requirements. If you need a breakdown of any section (e.g., class diagrams, FXML structure, or code templates), let me know!
