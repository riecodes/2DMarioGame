# Interactive System or Game Application Development Using Object-Oriented and Event-Driven Programming Concepts

## Final Project Requirement

### Objectives
Students will design and develop an interactive system or game application using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Event-Driven Programming (EDP) concepts in Java. The project will require students to apply their knowledge of Java Swing for GUI development, event handling, file handling, and OOP principles (inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction).

#### Upon completion of this project, students should be able to:
- Apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- Implement event-driven programming using event listeners (ActionListener, MouseListener, KeyListener, etc.).
- Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing components (JFrame, JPanel, JButton, JTextField, etc.).
- Integrate file-handling mechanisms (FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, and serialization) to store and retrieve data efficiently.
- Ensure data validation and error handling using exception handling techniques (try-catch).
- Create an engaging user experience with interactive elements, a user-friendly interface, and clear navigation.

### Instructions

#### 1. Project Scope
Students form a group of two (or more) and develop an interactive system or a game application that demonstrates OOP, event-driven programming, and file-handling concepts. The project should have a graphical user interface (GUI) and respond to user inputs through events.

**System Examples:**
- Inventory Management System
- Student Information System
- Library Management System
- Employee Payroll System
- Hotel Reservation System (etc.)

**Game Examples:**
- E-Learning Games
- Simple RPG or Adventure Game (etc.)

#### 2. Technical Requirements
- **Object-Oriented Design:** The project must include at least three classes, demonstrating inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Java Swing must be used for designing the application interface, using components such as JFrame, JPanel, JButton, JLabel, JTextField, JTable, etc.
- **Event Handling:** The system/game must handle user inputs through event-driven programming (e.g., ActionListener, MouseListener, KeyListener).
- **File Handling:** Data storage: The project must implement data persistence using file handling (FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, Object Serialization).
- **User Data Management:** The system must be able to save and load user data (e.g., game progress, records, system entries).
- **Error Handling:** The program must include exception handling (e.g., using try-catch blocks) to manage invalid inputs or errors.
- **User Interaction:** The application should have interactive elements that allow users to perform actions and receive feedback.

#### 3. Interface and User Experience
- The main menu must have navigation buttons or options to access different features.
- The GUI design must be user-friendly, with clear labels, instructions, and a well-structured layout (GridLayout, BorderLayout, etc.).
- The application should include at least three different screens, such as:
  - For Systems: Dashboard, Data Entry Form, Reports
  - For Games: Menu, Gameplay, Settings

#### 4. Submission Requirements
- **Source Code** (all Java files and assets)
- **Project Documentation** (includes project overview, system/game features, OOP/EDP concepts applied, file-handling implementation, and screenshots)
- **Demo Video** (short video showcasing how the system/game works)
- **Presentation** (each group will present their project for 5-10 minutes)
